this is how to make an omelet I'm using two eggs for mine to crack them I prefer to give it a quick pop on a flat surface now mix them together until they're completely Blended like this I'm using a small non-stick pan on somewhat low heat I set my burner on a heat of 3 out of ten I'll add half a tablespoon of butter and let it melt I'll also add a little olive oil you can use only butter or only oil it's up to you now that my butter is melted and warm I'll add my eggs touch it let it cook for a minute or so until the edges begin to set then gently push the edge towards the center and slightly tilty pan to let the uncooked egg move to the edge let it continue cooking I do this again after another minute and a half for the remaining uncooked egg [Music] once the egg is set but still soft I'll add my cheese I let mine cook with the cheese for about 30 seconds if you're using other cheeses you might want to wait longer this american cheese will finish getting gooey after I fold the omelet over then I add salt and pepper please consider giving the video a thumbs up and thank you for watching
