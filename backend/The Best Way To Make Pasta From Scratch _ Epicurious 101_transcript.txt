I'm Frank Proto I'm a professional chef and coloring instructor and today I'm going to show you how to make fresh pasta and today I'm going to show you how to make fresh pasta at home with eggs and without this is how to make pasta 101 box pasta is an everyday Workhorse making your own pasta at home or fresh pasta makes the meal a little more special it just takes a little time and technique in order to get it right I'm going to make two Do's today one with eggs and one without for my egg pasta I'm using an Italian dble zero flour dble zero flour is more finely ground than an allpurpose or a bread flour all that really means is that this flour is M or ground up really fine it supports that whole fine delicate pasta that egg pastas make but if you don't have double zero use an allpurpose or a bread flour if that's what you got use it and then I'm going to take my hand and just make a big well make sure you make this well big enough to hold the eggs if you have a tiny well and crack two eggs in the eggs overflow and we don't want that make it big Don't Be Afraid make a nice big volcano whenever I make fresh egg dough I usually do one egg per person so here I have about two cups of flour to two eggs so one cup of flour per egg I'm going to season this as well a fair amount of salt I'm scrambling this just for consistency and so that my dough is uniform throughout so once they're whisked I'm starting to bring the flour in try not to break your volcano at this point if you put this into a mixer you can just throw everything in turn it on and let it go but I'm doing it the granny style of the Nona style and basically I'm incorporating the flour a little at a time so that the eggs don't spill out all over my Surface or my counter so once we get to a point where it holds its own shape now I start to kind of just mix a fair amount of flour in there what's great about this technique is the dough is only going to take as much flour as it needs so at this point I usually get rid of my Fork I use my dough scraper you can use your fingers if you want now I just start chopping in some of this flour so I'm scraping up all the bits on the bottom of the board basically what I'm looking for here is that my dough is not wet anymore and it's not going to be sticking all over my hands now that my dough has come together we're going to start to knead it kneading the dough activates or works the gluten and basically gluten is a protein that gets stretchy and springy after you work it gluten is what makes your pasta chewy if you don't work your pasta dough enough you're not not going to get that nice chewy bite to your pasta and basically what I do when I need this is I push down with my body weight push away from me fold it in half give it a quarter turn push down with my body weight fold it in half give it a quarter turn and I just keep doing that until I get a nice elastic and smooth dough and this is what I'm looking for press down it's going to spring back that's how I know I have some gluten formation in my dough if you press down and it stays down you either need to add more flour or you need to keep kneading my dough is nice and elastic I'm going to wrap it in a piece of plastic and the reason I do this is so that the dough doesn't dry out anymore if it dries out it's going to get kind of like an alligator skin it's going to be really hard to roll out if I try and roll it out at this point I'm going to roll it and it's going to spring back if I let it relax for about 20 to 30 minutes when I roll it it's going to hold that nice flat shape I'm using plastic if you don't want to use that you could wrap it in a clean towel or you could take a bowl and turn it upside down over the dough that's my egg based dough I'm going to let this rest for about 20 minutes and then we can roll it out pasta dough made with eggs tends to be a little more delicate a little richer whereas pasta D made with just water tend to be harder and hold heavier sauces a little more dense I usually refer the one without as a semolina Dough because I'm going to use semolina flour it has a little more texture to it it's a little more grainy than a finely ground flour and most of the time that you buy box pasta It's usually made from water salt and semolina flour so I have about 2 cups of semolina and about 2/3 cup of water and a heft pinch of salt don't break the walls of your volcano and start working in your semolina I love using bent scrapers they cost about a dollar and they're a great Gadget to have to clean up surfaces to cut D's and they're totally worth it it's a super versatile piece of kitchen equipment that cost nearly nothing okay so now that it's coming together I can see that that the dough is just a little dry so all I'm going to do is add a little bit of water you don't want to go crazy here if you have to add water if you have to add flour you do it in small measures you might be wondering can I over mix this and form too much gluten yes you can but by that time you'd probably be passed out on the floor cuz you're so darn tired your arms will want to fall off and we're going to wrap this for the same reason we wrapped the egg dough we don't want it to form a skin put it aside let it si for about 20 minutes and then we can roll that out too we're going to start with the semina dough I'm going to put the egg dough aside forget about it for a sec just it's going to be okay just leave it alone Cavatelli is basically a smooth outside with a shell-like interior it looks kind of like an elongated seashell Cavatelli tends to be a little more dense it tends to be a little more of a hearty and chewy pasta that's why this semolina dough works really well for it Cavatelli can be formed with just your hands uh I have a couple of piece of equipment I'm going to use as like options you can see different options for it I'm going to cut a little piece of the dough off and leave the rest covered cuz I don't want this to dry out what I'm going to do here for the Cavatelli is just roll this out into a snake so I'm just going to cut these into kind of a little long nuggets I try and keep these at a uniform size so that all the pasta Cooks evenly they don't have to be exact just try and keep them as uniform as possible now you could buy a yokie board they're about 10 bucks online uh but I had a tree go down in my backyard and I made this one myself you could see more projects like this on my other channel Proto makes this to me is the best way to make Cavatelli pasta shapes are basically made in order to hold or capture a sauce so this method to me not only gives you the little cup that holds the sauce it gives you some nice ridges on the outside so you press your doughball down and squeeze right so I'm pressing my dough ball down pushing down and away from myself and making that nice cup those ridges and that cup in the middle are the surface area that holds your sauce so this to me is the more classic shape if you want to use your finger you can take your thumb press down and roll away from you to form that nice kind of Cavatelli shape you can see there's like an interior shell a smooth outside so that's that's our nice shape we got there that's our Cavatelli with no special equipment just to prove that it can be done Grandma's everywhere been doing this for years it's not complicated another way to do this is with a butter knife and this one I'm going to pull towards myself slight angle to the board a little bit of downward pressure and pull towards yourself the downward pressure lets the pasta kind of stick to the board a little it kind of squeezes the pasta out the other end at the end of the day there's really no difference between the knife and the finger technique some people just feel more comfortable with a knife they get a knack for it it's kind of a knack thing the next method is an overturn fork with a fork technique I just take the fork I'm not using it like I'm eating I turn turn it upside down I'm kind of giving these a little Squish and I'm pushing down into the fork and away from myself just to kind of form that cup what I'm accomplishing here with this is I'm making really fat ridges so the sauce doesn't just sit inside the seashell it grabs the outside as well let's put the Cavatelli aside and work with our egg dough for my egg based dough I'm making a paperell which is a long thick wide pasta it's kind of like fetuccini but like triple as wide this is a kitchena with a flat roller attachment this makes it go fast and easy I have my dough ball I'm going to unwrap it I'm not going to use it all because if you try and put all of this through the machine it's just going to shred it I'm going to do about 1/3 of it right now and I'm going to recover I'm just going to flatten it out and I'm going to dust it lightly with some flour we didn't need flour for the semolina Dough because it's a nice dry dough this has a little more moisture to it so I'm just going to put some flour on the outside so it doesn't stick to our rollers I have my roller on one now one is the thickest some people might think one is the thinnest but no I roll it through with one hand and I get it with the other hand one thing I like to do now is give it a fold and all that this does is make my pasta a little more square and even and I'm going to leave it on that number one setting and have it go through again I'm going to lightly dust and then I'm going to go up one number to two going from one to two makes our pasta dough a little bit thinner as long as there's enough flour on here you can go down another one to three and make it a little thinner my goal here is to go from number one to number seven number eight tends to be a little too thin as you get faster with this and better at this you can just go down the numbers at this point it's starting to get long and a little unruly I like to use the backs of my hands not my fingers cuz I don't want my fingers poking through now I'm down to seven which is the number that I want to hit roll it into the machine if you're going to do this by hand you would basically roll this out with a little flower and a rolling pin and then you need a nap afterwards cuz it takes a really long time to do so at this point we can cut this in half and we have two nice sheets of pasta what I like to do to get my papell at this point is to flour the inside really well so it doesn't stick to itself and then we're going to roll it up and then I get some nice even clean cuts lay this out flat on a tray I try not to stack it because I don't want it sticking to itself you can put it really nice and close to each other all right maybe I'll stack a little and that is my finished papell so now we have our finished Cavatelli and paperell time to cook them I'm going to cook the pasta now and I'm starting with the Cavatelli I have a pot of water here that I'm going to Salt some people would say sea salty it's a good start we salt the pasta water so that the pasta absorbs the salty water hence our pasta is seasoned if you salt the pasta at the end basically you're going to have a salty sauce with a bland pasta this way our pasta is seasoned our sauce is seasoned and it's magic the water is seasoned and I want it to be boiling before I add the pasta in when I put the pasta in it's going to stop boiling but I want it to come as quickly as possible back up to the boil so first of all the pasta doesn't stick together and it doesn't just sit on the bottom and start to get mushy we want this pasta to have texture and if it's not boiling and not moving around it's just going to mush out and get soggy water's boiling water is seasoned pasta goes in give it a stir so it doesn't stick to the bottom and it does doesn't stick to each other how do you know when your pasta is done for me the only way you know that your pasta is done is to actually taste it people say throw it against the wall what does that prove my pasta is starchy that proves nothing to me eat it taste it put it in your mouth hole while my pasta is cooking I always have my sauce ready to go the sauce waits for the pasta not the other way have your sauce hot and ready to go in a pan before you even start cooking your pasta now that my pasta's been cooking for a few minutes I have this thing it's called the spider cuz it kind of looks like a spiderweb and it's just a great straining tool to have in your house I usually let my pasta just cool a little and then I give it a taste perfect I have a little chew to it the pasta is cooked all the way through it's not doughy and gummy it has some bite to it it tastes cooked so now what I do is I take my spider and get my pasta out and it goes directly into the sauce I don't drain it all that well I want some of that pasta water in there the pasta water has salt and starch and that salt and starch is going to to help make my finished sauce a little more creamy so my sauce looks a little thick I'm going to go into my pasta pot get some of the water and dump it in so it loosens my sauce so in Italy it'll cook it about 3/4 of the way and finish the cooking process in the sauce so it's done cooking let's throw it on the plate a little bit of our chiffonade basil on top and that's my Cavatelli with a semolina base pasta dough I have my paperell from our egg dough my water is boiling I'm going to add some salt I have my cream sauce here and cream sauce generally gets paired with long thin noodles cuz it sticks really well and we're going to drop our pasta in the papell will cook quicker than the Cavatelli it's only going to cook for about 2 or 3 minutes I'm going to swirl it around the papel is super thin that's why it's going to cook so quickly I like to use tongs for long thin pasta a spider usually it's kind of just problematic and they fall off the spider so I feel like tongs are the best way to go with this let it cool off give it a quick taste smooth silky just a little bit of bite to it I'm going to take a little bit of that pasta water swirl it around it's important to have the burner on here because when we add the pasta water now it's going to be too liquidy we want some of that liquid to actually cook off a little and cook onto the pasta so you don't want to just do this in a cold pan you want to make sure that it's cooking okay that looks great so I get my plate I'm going to give this a little bit of a a Twist so it makes a little bit of a bird's nest just get my spoon under it so I don't drip everywhere and that's my papell made with egg pasta with a cream sauce so there it is it's our semolina based Cavatelli with a nice rich tomato sauce and our egg based papadeli with a cream based sauuce yes it's easy to use pasta out of the box but when you make someone homemade pasta they know they're loved it feels like a big hug both of the pastas I made today have simple humble ingredients and a little bit of technique and if you follow the techniques that I laid out here today you will be able to make professional grap pasta at home
